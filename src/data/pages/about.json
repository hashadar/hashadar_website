    "content": "I graduated from University College London in 2023 with a degree in Mechanical Engineering. While engineering might seem like a departure from my current work in AI and data, the analytical thinking and problem-solving skills I developed have been fundamental to my career trajectory. Engineering taught me to approach complex problems systematically, to break down challenges into manageable components, and to think critically about how systems interact. These principles translate directly to my work in AI and data consulting, where I'm constantly analysing systems, identifying patterns, and designing solutions that are both technically sound and practically implementable. My technical foundation in engineering provides a unique perspective when evaluating AI architectures and data infrastructure, allowing me to consider not just the software layer but the broader system implications."
